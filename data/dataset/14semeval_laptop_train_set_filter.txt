in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure , so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it very clever con .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you 're gaming .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O
i love the way the entire suite of software works together .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O

-no backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure , talk about painless syncing , used to take me forever , now it 's a snap .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30" hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in bios setup directly , i gave upi am a techie .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i sent it back to toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O
in desparation , i called their customer service number and was told that my warranty had expired 2 days old and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me have your credit card ready .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
drivers updated ok but the bios update froze the system up and the computer shut down .|||B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
speaking of the browser , it too has problems .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the keyboard is too slick .|||O B-AP O O O O
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
amazing quality !|||O B-AP O
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O
i mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files pics , vids , etc .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
if a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i love the glass touchpad .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O
i am using the external speaker sound is good .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from hp .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
everything is so easy to use , mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .|||O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
and if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar can not be beat .|||O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
it has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O

enabling the battery timer is useless .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O

there is no need to purchase virus protection for mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
but we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
so , i paid a visit to lg notebook service center at alexandra road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
my daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
it is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
they had to replace the motherboard in april|||O O O O O B-AP O O
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
also , if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

it had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core i7 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
if you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run windows applications , go with an apple ;|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
you wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that .|||O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O

keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
yes , a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O
the keyboard feels good and i type just fine on it .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i thought the white mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O
yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of "extra key" , etc .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

i wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
one drawback , i wish the keys were backlit .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O
acer was no help and garmin could not determine the problemafter spending about 2 hours with me , so i returned it and purchased a toshiba r700 that seems even nicer and i was able to load all of my software with no problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

i dual boot with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .|||O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O

because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just took the broken cords into the apple store and they gave me new ones .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .|||O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
