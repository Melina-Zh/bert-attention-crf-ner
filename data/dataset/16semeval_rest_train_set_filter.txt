the yellowtail was particularly good as well .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
not one of our meals was edible , bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
fish was overdone .|||B-AP O O O
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .|||O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O

the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O

the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O

and $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O
do n't get me started on the margaritas , either .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
oh , and i never write reviews -- i just was so moved by how bad this place was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house even the gyro meat and sausages , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the veal was incredible last night .|||O B-AP O O O O O
this place is a must visit !|||O B-AP O O O O O
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like that couple .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish i 'm a daring eater but not that daring .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O

thank you everyone at water's edge .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O
service ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .|||B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
the high prices you 're going to pay is for the view not for the food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
the bar drinks were eh , ok to say the least .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
the stuff tilapia was horridtasted like cardboard .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
we thought the dessert would be better , wrong !|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
the wine list was extensive , though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
the bread we received was horrible , rock hard and cold , and the free appetizer of olives was disappointing .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
however , our main course was wonderful .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
i had fish and my husband had the filet , both of which exceeded our expectations .|||O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
the dessert we had a pear torte was good , but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
when we inquired about ports , the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
all in all , i would return , as it was a beautiful restaurant , but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
short and sweet , seating is great , it 's romantic , cozy and private .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was extremely fast and attentivethanks to the service button on your table but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
subtle food and service|||O B-AP O O
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O
servers are all different , greg is my favorite .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O
sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first place i 've been that a runner remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

food took some time to prepare , all worth waiting for .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
maggot in the food !|||O O O B-AP O
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i got hair in my food 2 times of then !|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O

yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !|||O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O

i 've had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
indo chinese food , pretty good .|||B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food .|||O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she being indian feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was speechless by the horrible food .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place survives on reputation alone .|||O B-AP O O O O O
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city , not just brooklyn .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

hands down the best pizza on the planet .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O
great hot dogs .|||O B-AP I-AP O
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
the only thing that strikes you is the decor ? not very pleasant .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
this place has great indian chinese food .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O
best indian chinese in the city , by far !|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

everything on the menu is great .|||O O O B-AP O O O
this establishment is the real deal .|||O B-AP O O O O O
wish ny had more of these kind of places , intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ?|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
look , the appetizers were really good .|||O O O B-AP O O O O
the entree was also very good .|||O B-AP O O O O O
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
vanison was good but not amazing .|||B-AP O O O O O O
bison was quite excellent however .|||B-AP O O O O O
dessert , pure disaster .|||B-AP O O O O
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i 've been to the four seasons restaurant .|||B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , the food was great except for the dessserts .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the place is beautiful !|||O B-AP O O O
the hostess was very pleasant .|||O B-AP O O O O
however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly , an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the lobster knuckles special of the day were ok , but pretty tasteless .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
i had the thai style fried sea bass was very good .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
all in all the food was good , a little on the expensive side , but fresh .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service not the friendliest to our large party !|||B-AP O O O O O O O O

food was amazing , i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very normal indian food , but done really well .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala , no bread of rice , is $ 25 , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

easily the worst stir-fried squid i 've ever tasted .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O

the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .|||O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O

i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
the sake's complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from philly , yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n't say enough good things about this brasserie .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is where it really really gets bad , the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O

only complaint is the pricing -- i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
but nonetheless -- great spot , great food .|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O

there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in , except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
