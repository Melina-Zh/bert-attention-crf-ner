in fact , this was not a nicoise salad and was barely eatable .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O

the menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
the food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O
this made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
appetizer are excellent here ; you can make a great and inexpensive meal out of them .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

the food was almost always excellent .|||O B-AP O O O O O
i was pleasently surprised at the taste .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
a nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make mare a great choice for seafood lovers .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O
i never had an orange donut before so i gave it a shot .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
this particular location certainly uses substandard meats .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
the management was less than accomodating .|||O B-AP O O O O O
the ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O
mojitos and the service are the best part in there|||B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O

the food was wonderful and imaginative .|||O B-AP O O O O O

most importantly , it is reasonably priced .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
the selection of food is excellent i 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants , and the atmosphere is great .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O
food was decent , but not great .|||B-AP O O O O O O O
i do n't know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
the waiters always look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the si mall .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was well worth the money .|||O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the service we experienced was friendly and good .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he did n't have a supportive staff to work with .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the folding chair i was seated at was uncomfortable .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O

the sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
it had been awhile and i forgot just how delicious crepes can be .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .|||O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had a delicious shrimp creole .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O

what a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
frankly , the chinese food here is something i can make better at home .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

for the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other japanese restaurants .|||O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food portion was small and below average .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
my favs here are the tacos pastor and the tostada de tinga .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
the bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
for a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal , try the hot and sour soup .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
this bar has it all , great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent service and delicious food .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O

everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
it 's traditional , simple italian food .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the food is all-around good , with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level .|||O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the sashimi is cut a little thinly .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
could have had better for 1/3 the price in chinatown .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O

well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
when the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .|||O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced and the food was below average when they actually gave people the meals they ordered .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
it 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O B-AP O

it 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
the unattractive lighting made me want to gag , the food was overpriced , there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O

the service is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .|||O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
because the waiters need severe attitue adjustments .|||O O B-AP O O O O O
the food is delicious and highly recommended .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
when it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wantedexcuse me but is n't that his job ? ? ? .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
