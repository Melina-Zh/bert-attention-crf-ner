i bought a hp pavilion dv4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and i have to direct my concern to the "sales" team , which is the retail shop which i bought my netbook from .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i investigated netbooks and saw the toshiba nb305-n410bl .|||O O O O O O O O O
the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is of high quality , has a killer gui , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
sad very sad .|||O O O O
i even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , ichat , photobooth , garage band and more !|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O
needless to say a pc that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop that offers many great features !|||O O O O O O B-AP O
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
still pretty pricey , but i 've been putting off money for a while as a little macbook fund , and finally got to use it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took it back for an asus and same thing blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure , so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it very clever con .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you 're gaming .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate this one .|||O O O O O
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !|||O O O O
but while this is one big advantage as you may know from the company s recent commercials there are other things to consider before going with apple .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the way the entire suite of software works together .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n't without my laptop for long this time !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this laptop meets every expectation and windows 7 is great !|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
that 's how frustrating it was .|||O O O O O O O
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
the one down side to it is that when i play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-no backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
i ca n't even turn it off .|||O O O O O O O O
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure , talk about painless syncing , used to take me forever , now it 's a snap .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i shopped around before buying .|||O O O O O O
i also got the added bonus of a 30" hd monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
would do business again .|||O O O O O
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning 2 of these laptops .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste .|||O O O O
it was a total dhell experience that i will never repeat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are a few flaws as well that i noticed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .|||O O O O O O O O O
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, in the past four years i 've had it i have never once gotten a virus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've tried going back to xl but there still problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O
after numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in bios setup directly , i gave upi am a techie .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
but it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sent it back to toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
and this is n't just my one experine .|||O O O O O O O O O
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends|||O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my mac , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
also kinda loud when the fan was running .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O
in desparation , i called their customer service number and was told that my warranty had expired 2 days old and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me have your credit card ready .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
drivers updated ok but the bios update froze the system up and the computer shut down .|||B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O
-they lost my laptop for a month|||O O O O O O O
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
this is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first !|||O O O
speaking of the browser , it too has problems .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O
i think just going from pc to mac has gotten me totally spoiled and i ca n't imagine ever going back .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keyboard is too slick .|||O B-AP O O O O
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it 's like 9 punds , but if you can look past it , it 's great !|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
still under warrenty so called toshiba , no help at all .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i love it !|||O O O O
amazing quality !|||O B-AP O
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O
i mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files pics , vids , etc .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is on the top of the stack .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this machine delivers .|||O O O O
then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i complain again .|||O O O O
this laptop is insane ! ! !|||O O O O O O O
if a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
what an elegant , wonderful machine .|||O O O O O O O
this is now my 3rd macbook pro and i really honestly love it !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for 2 months .|||O O O O
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
do you ever think hp would do that ? never !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
we upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
it 's not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still trying to learn how to use it .|||O O O O O O O O O
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
i bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll save our money to replace it with a mac again !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank you for your great product !|||O O O O O O O
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
overall this laptop is great .|||O O O O O O
i love the glass touchpad .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O
i am using the external speaker sound is good .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
the apple mc371ll/a 24ghz 154-inch macbook pro notebook is a horrible waste of money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i wo n't have to worry about a crash .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from hp .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .|||O O O O O O O O O O
good luck .|||O O O
everything is so easy to use , mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .|||O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
also i typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar can not be beat .|||O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
it has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O

i eventually did the migration from my imac backup disc which uses usb .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP O
those things are very important , vital even !|||O O O O O O O O O
-they say it will take up to two weeks .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't like one thing about it .|||O O O O O O O O O
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
enabling the battery timer is useless .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O

after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
they had to replace the motherboard in april|||O O O O O B-AP O O
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
also , if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
i especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O

this is my first computer purchase|||O O O O O O
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the processor a amd semprom at 21 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

well i got this computer from best buy and i have had nothing but problems i bought the computer with a virus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i like how the mac os is so simple and easy to use .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O
while apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it ca n't get any better .|||O O O O O O O
all the problems i have had with pc 's are solved with a mac , the issue of overheating-my dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my hp completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only good thing is the graphics quality .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O
in short i would never buy a compaq again .|||O O O O O O O O O O

also it is light weight compared to others .|||O O O O O O O O O
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O
sorry , newegg .|||O O O O

originally bought it for my wife .|||O O O O O O O
it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
also , the extended warranty was a problem .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
boots up fast and runs great !|||B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O
lightweight and the screen is beautiful !|||O O O B-AP O O O
buy it , love it , and i promise you wo n't regret it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed a driver for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just a month and a half or two months ago , my vaio crashed again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
a coupla months later , they change my hard drive .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the 13 macbook pro is portable , durable , and very capable .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great overall .|||O O O
my smart phone is faster !|||O O O O O O
they say sorry out of warranty .|||O O O O O B-AP O
i have full control at all times of what is going on , there is no control+alt+delete business anymore .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O
pc never worked right even after bios fixed .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O
after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second macbook .|||O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the macbook pro to get my work done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are several programs for garageband pages , garageband , garageband , etc , music garageband , photo management photo booth , iphoto , video-editing or movie-making imovie , etc .|||O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen shows great colors .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O
reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's a huge difference .|||O O O O O O
dells are ok , hps are n't that good , but macs or fantastic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , buyers beware !|||O O O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little toshie !|||O O O O O O O O O
i have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam , just for starters .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
again , i sent it off to acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
definitely recommended ! ! !|||O O O O O
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .|||O O O O O O O O
let me start with the good , so awesome .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i had finally reached my limit and broke down .|||O O O O O O O O O O
the 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the bluetooth to work properly , you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd , or it will not show after the reload .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no laptop .|||O O O O O O O O
everything is falling apart internally and externally .|||O O O O O O O O
i also liked the glass screen .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its a dog plain and simple .|||O O O O O O O
when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
my hp is very heavy .|||O O O O O O
i bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months if it is overload with updates the boot mgr .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price and features more than met my needs .|||O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O
they refuse .|||O O O
big mistake !|||O O O
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net  when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , i 've been dell fan for more than fifteen years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great investment !|||O O O
i am just amazed .|||O O O O O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and i would n't have the same problems because it was updated .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse buttons are hard to push .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .|||O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
if you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just do n't waste your time and money on this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap vaio .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
games being the main issue .|||B-AP O O O O O
no problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .|||O O O O O O O O O O
while the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the pc world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am definitely sold , and not going back to pcs for home use !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a lapdesk which i can use , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
it was over rated !|||O O O O O
i do n't understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
i was n't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other thoughts , do not purchase this product .|||O O O O O O O O O
they say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive i do n't really understand why but anyway .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
and looks very sexyy , d really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank god for ctrl zbottom line , i 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they definitely have a superior product !|||O O O O O O O
a great computer for light home use and business use .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
bought it to use mostly for oline classes .|||O O O O O O O O O
even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer was awful !|||O O O O O
heck , if i had enough money , i would but it as a gift for someone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even so , i like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
the battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my previous purchases were with dell and hp .|||O O O O O O O O O
i have not have any problems .|||O O O O O O O
i purchased an hp right after my high school graduation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from pc ;|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O

sent unit back and it 's been two months .|||O O O O O O O O O O
came fully loaded , good .|||O O B-AP O O O
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista users ? they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .|||O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
when we bought our new hp comouter in dec of 2008 , we wanted windows xp , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with vista .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i definatly ca n't .|||O O O O O
files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
it is meant to be portable .|||O O O O O O O
my laptop worked again for just a while before i started having issues again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is perfect for her field .|||O O O O O O O
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase|||O O O O O O O O O
that 's the downside for me .|||O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully amazon will take this back .|||O O O O O O O
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot" has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i needed a laptop for school use .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
he ca n't stand it .|||O O O O O O
the computer was delivered as promised .|||O O O O O O O
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i would like at least a 4 hr battery life .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the only thing that i do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
looking online , many people are having the same problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second mac book pro .|||O O O O O O O O
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
theres a built in camera with special effects for video and photography .|||O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .|||O O O O O B-AP O
i went right out and purchased another laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O
long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i already own an iphone , and so the move just made more sense .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer gets very hot , before shutting down .|||O O O O O O O O O O
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
went silently .|||O O O
satisfy what i paid for it .|||O O O O O O O
it is trash !|||O O O O
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .|||O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
clear picture on it and everything .|||O B-AP O O O O O
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so useable and responsive .|||O O O O O O O
it is truly a desktop replacement .|||O O O O O O O
i only used it to browse the internet and and i do n't know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
very long-life battery up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
screen is awesome , battery life is good .|||B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance , one of the better looking notebooks i 've seen .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
and if u did .|||O O O O O
i 've had the macbook pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
it was definelty a smart move .|||O O O O O O O
i 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .|||O O O O O O O O O
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
handles all my basic media needs easily .|||O O O O O O O O
just what the doctor ordered .|||O O O O O O
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
excellent speed for processing data .|||O B-AP O O O O
all in all , i 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with hp as a whole .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O

it does n't heat up like my old laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

until i bought the dell , i thought you just looked for what you wanted size , software , options , hardware and purchase the best deal you could find .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i do n't know how i could ever live without my qousmio .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

i would recommend this product .|||O O O O O O
if i had to buy another computer , i would most definetly buy an acer one computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is framed by half to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software im used to cs5 but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .|||O O B-AP O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this macbook is an outstanding product with great value .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

i had to call apple 19 times each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset status of repair .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .|||O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the macbook pro .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
keyboard is reasonable size .|||B-AP O O B-AP O
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to louisville ky .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm now trying to decide on another dell model .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the macbook is a fantastic laptop .|||O O O O O O O
fan noise , the fan made a constant hissing noise in the background .|||B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three tabs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best buy rocks !|||O O O O
a couple things you should know ,|||O O O O O O O

this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love it !|||O O O O
with windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
i had been a windows user before this i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet , artwork , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
very good quality and well made .|||O O B-AP O O O O
i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp , but i use the touchpad 90 % of the time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

the screen resolution was exactly what i was looking for .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
even though it is running snow leopard , 24 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP O B-AP O

he said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not worth it one bit .|||O O O O O O
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products , it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
such as pages , numbers , and so on .|||O O O O O O O O O O
my laptop now has no battery .|||O O O O O B-AP O

, -if you buy this , do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O

the mac version of microsoft office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the toshiba net book operates very well .|||O O O O B-AP O O O
i loved it .|||O O O O
the touch pad is fine , again , it 's a real touch pad .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the pictures are clear as can be .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
if anything , i would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i sit down and use my husband 's work pc and i do n't like it one bit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i like it better than my big dell laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer service agents for those who live in the united states .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and aftereffects programs easily .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O
it 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
heck , i like all mac computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the us is going through .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O
the machine itself is alright .|||O O O O O O
it seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like i thought they would .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do n't run accross a situation like this again !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also experience the same with my macbook air .|||O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
tons of bloatware and junk programs .|||O O O O O B-AP O
its sad because their commercials are great .|||O O O O O O O O
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .|||O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O
luckily , dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought a mac .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never been hacked .|||O O O O
it 's so bad that i 'm thinking i only got half a battery or something .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .|||O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .|||O O O O O O O O O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .|||O O O O O O O O
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy refurbished again , i do n't cae how cheap it is .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it is just slow slow slow .|||O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple macbook pro , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so this was great for me .|||O O O O O O O
this is the first macbook i have ever had .|||O O O O O O O O O O
the acer one compuer is a great computer .|||O O O O O O O O O
another problem .|||O O O
the macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
so , if you 're thinking of a laptop , i would heartily recommend theapple 133 macbook pro notebook computer z0j80001 notebook for all your needs ! .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
i picked it out becaaspect0 it was inexpensive $ 400 and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
my only problem is i can not reg the product key .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb *maximum* .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have bluetooth .|||O O O O O B-AP O
sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a pc user my whole life .|||O O O O O O O O
great battery life .|||O B-AP I-AP O
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
at first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
delivery was early too .|||B-AP O O O O
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love the stability of the mac software and operating system .|||O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
i left the place angrily .|||O O O O O O
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had a toshiba laptop in the past ;|||O O O O O O O O O O
it 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
asus said my net-book was working properly .|||O O O O O O O O
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .|||O O O
my main reason to convert was the imovie program .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it has a faster processor and more ram .|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
if you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O

received the product promptly and without any issues .|||O O O O O O O O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so i was now on the second motherboard within 3 months .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

love the speed , especially !|||O O B-AP O O O
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O
not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
by air sounds more like by truck to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this laptop leaves alot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O B-AP O

moral of the story , -do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .|||O O O O O O O O O
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they told me to reprogram the computer , and i did n't need to do that , and i lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i took the computer into best buy where i purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may be reading one now !|||O O O O O O O
the only thing i wish is the 15 inch macbook pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
now , as easy as it is to use , and i do think it is a great starter laptop .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
this causes my wrist to scrape up against it .|||O O O O O O O O O O
enough said .|||O O O
setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .|||B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
it had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
ever since i bought this laptop , so far i 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O
i do not plan on going back .|||O O O O O O O O
no laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i really like the mac 154in notebook , but its very pricey .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .|||B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
called tech support and got the usual acer we do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
i would never tell anyone to buy one either .|||O O O O O O O O O O
the programs are great , like iphoto love the editing capabilities , imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad , imovie , etc .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the only thing i did n't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n't say enough good for it !|||O O O O O O O O O
comfterbale to use light easy to transport .|||O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O
i thought the price was great for the specs .|||O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
just for a stupid cd .|||O O O O O O
keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it crashes , and when it goes flat , it just dies like a pc , maybe worse and i loose all my open documents !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point .|||O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i'v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook - of course a different brand .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downfall is the volume control .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
clearly , there is something wrong with the product and lg did n't take up the responsibility .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very fast boot up and shut down .|||O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
right out of the box , this little netbook did everything i asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy with this laptop .|||O O O O O O O O
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
what a mistake !|||O O O O
if internet connectivity is important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a usb wireless card .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
my last computer , a toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it discharges too quickly .|||O B-AP O O O
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy a pc next time .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem .|||O O O O O O O
then it ceased charging at all .|||O O O B-AP O O O
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
* is a bit laggy , not the greatest .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
stay away from hp .|||O O O O O
the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
i like it !|||O O O O
the pricing is very competitive .|||O B-AP O O O O
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
its still going .|||O O O O
this computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
there is no way i will buy a lg product in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
prior to this computer , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the advantages of owning a mac are numerous .|||O O O O O O O O O
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 25 hrs out of it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
using this machine is like a mild form of torture .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
on the twelfth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer blinks it shuts off at will .|||O O O O O O O O O
excellent product for the money .|||O O O O O O
it 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum , easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i have vista , so i am unable to install and unaspect2 some programs .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .|||O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can do everything i could before , only faster and more efficiently .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i do n't want it too .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the plethora of problems , i managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
two times with in one month .|||O O O O O O O
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

eventually we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the machine that was causing the problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O

when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they expedited the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a senior tech .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

after a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would never buy a dell again .|||O O O O O O O O
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows laptop !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit .|||O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O

this notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this little one .|||O O O O O O
so not having my laptop was discouraging .|||O O O O O O O O

1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops , it is worth the price .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and i 'll never buy another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

on two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it came alot faster than i thought it would have which was really exciting .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O
but if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
also the display is exceptional !|||O O B-AP O O O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

at first when i got this product , i loved it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this computer is super lame .|||O O O O O O O O
it had a seventeen inch screen which i wanted , but i did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

without a doubt , the *aspect0* of this laptop is fantastic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O

now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O

i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram 2x2gb for $ 92 or 1x4gb for $ 99 , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8gb of ram .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
this is one of the reasons i purchased it .|||O O O O O O O O O O
instead of taking another chance on toshiba , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she told me flatly , it 's like that one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
if you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is the easiest computer i have ever used|||O O O O O O O O O
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes which usually slows down my pc .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O

again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just got this laptop for college , and so far i am very happy with it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .|||B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

first , it does not have a push button to open the lid .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O

the laptop is gorgeous .|||O O O O O
it 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way , and apple does , indeed , have the better idea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hp did n't fix it .|||O O O O O O
applications respond immediately not like the tired ms applications .|||B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
all in all , a very disappointing experience except that i learned how good the geek squad is and also customer service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the laptop is very lightaspect1 , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs , programs , etc simultaneously .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O O O O
the problems started with just the screen freezing .|||O O O O O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !|||O O O O O O O
i also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O

defective software .|||O B-AP O
this computer was so challenging to carry and handle .|||O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .|||B-AP O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

when i called sony the customer service was great .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

everything about this computer is easy to use .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
after paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
worse , for the price i could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
