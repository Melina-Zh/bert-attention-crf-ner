the yellowtail was particularly good as well .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .|||O B-AP O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny -- i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
not one of our meals was edible , bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
fish was overdone .|||B-AP O O O
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .|||O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
someone else recommended the dessert , we also left that .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O

we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village , not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce even its low sodium , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
