At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.####At=O this=O point=O ,=O the=O waitress=T comes=O over=O and=O asks=O us=O if=O everything=O was=O okay=O ,=O I=O was=O literally=O so=O shocked=O that=O I=O was=O speechless=O and=O did=O n't=O say=O anything=O ,=O and=O guess=O what=O ,=O the=O waitress=T WALKED=O away=O .=O
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.####So=O ,=O I=O switch=O with=O my=O boyfriend=O again=O to=O see=O if=O maybe=O I=O could=O stomach=O the=O meat=O and=O spinach=T again=O ,=O but=O the=O spinach=T was=O so=O undercooked=O that=O I=O just=O could=O not=O bite=O through=O it=O .=O

There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. ####There=O 's=O another=O girl=T who=O I=O ca=O n't=O describe=O ,=O she=O is=O about=O 5'6=O with=O brown=O hair=O ,=O who=O eavesdrops=O on=O your=O conversation=O and=O chimes=O in=O ,=O except=O she=O only=O hears=O the=O last=O part=O of=O what=O you=O said=O ,=O so=O her=O uninvited=O opinions=O are=O often=O out=O of=O context=O and=O nothing=O to=O do=O with=O what=O you=O 're=O *really*=O talking=O about=O .=O

The food is very good, but not outstanding.####The=O food=T is=O very=O good=O ,=O but=O not=O outstanding=O .=O

The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).####The=O waitress=T came=O to=O check=O in=O on=O us=O every=O few=O minutes=O ,=O and=O began=O to=O clear=O the=O plates=O while=O half=O of=O us=O were=O still=O eating=O a=O big=O pet=O peeve=O of=O mine=O that=O happens=O almost=O everywhere=O ,=O so=O I=O try=O to=O ignore=O it=O .=O
