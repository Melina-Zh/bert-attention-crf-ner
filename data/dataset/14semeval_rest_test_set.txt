the menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
the food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O
this made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
appetizer are excellent here ; you can make a great and inexpensive meal out of them .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

the ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O

the selection of food is excellent i 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants , and the atmosphere is great .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O

yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was well worth the money .|||O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O

it had been awhile and i forgot just how delicious crepes can be .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .|||O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

frankly , the chinese food here is something i can make better at home .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O

i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
good cake but , it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone , but they were out of it that day .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O

i have to say the place was awesome .|||O O O O O O O O O
the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O
we requested they re-slice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food horrible bartenders , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

highly recommended as stated , i have n't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place ; also , the bar looks nice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
the ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers nice non-sushi selection .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O
it took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
who said go when the place is quiet during the day ?|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

very nice touch that very much fits the place .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O
however , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
if you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while i was there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the comments about fried foods is correct below but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
it 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sauce is excellent very fresh with dabs of real mozzarella .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
do n't ever bother , the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
prices even outside of restaurant week were great .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O
a small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
before the place did n't call my attention .|||O O O O O O O O O
and all the [female] servers are cute too , which is always nice .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
the best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets .|||O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
for an appetizer , their calamari is a winner .|||O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O
satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service and food is always on the money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O
after dinner i heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O

the room is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is bland and nothing extrodinary .|||O O O O O O O
i was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O

i 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
several times and put up with the waiters bad manners , knowing that their job is n't easy .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

we were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot , that this was n't a place we 'd return to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for .|||O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
while the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best i have ever had !|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
the food is just okay , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
the new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites but they raised the prices , the staff is friendly most of the time , but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words , no , ca n't , sorry , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O

its good to go there for drink if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O
anyway , the owner was fake .|||O O O B-AP O O O
