i 've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O

the staff is pretty friendly .|||O B-AP O O O O
the onion rings are great !|||O B-AP I-AP O O O
i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give youwere not good .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
nice ambience , but highly overrated place .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
worst service i ever had|||O B-AP O O O
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
fabulous italian food !|||O B-AP I-AP O
i highly recommend mioposto .|||O O O B-AP O
i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance i experience at this restaurant .|||O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O
the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not a bad thing to say about this place .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the food was great !|||O B-AP O O O
it 's *very* reasonably priced , esp for the quality of the food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i had the kafta plate and it was perfect .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time !|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
caution , its real food for people who love the best .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .|||O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .|||B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
however , the value and service are both severely lacking .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
on a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
freshest sushi , i love this restaurant .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
their apps are all delicious .|||O B-AP O O O O
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
but the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the food was not great & the waiters were rude .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O
my service was stellar !|||O B-AP O O O
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food was fine , with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa .|||B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O
the food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mama mia , i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it 's edible , even when you order ahead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
best sushi in town .|||O B-AP O O O
the best calamari in seattle !|||O O B-AP O O O
and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O
by far the best bar in the east village .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O
every time 0-sixtynine is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O
definitely has one of the best jukebox's i 've seen in a long long time .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
the food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
and the upstairs is a great place to hang out .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
not alot of smoking places left in new york , but i have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the sushi here is delicious !|||O B-AP O O O O
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've had the jellyfish , horse mackerel , blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others , and they were all good .|||O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the decor is rustic , traditional japanese .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
the crowd is mixed yuppies , young and old .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O
the service was courteous and attentive .|||O B-AP O O O O O
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
my g/f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
service was decent .|||B-AP O O O
drinks were good .|||B-AP O O O
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n't recommend going here .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O
i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was romantic , and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
best indian food in la .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .|||O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
the chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
it 's located in a strip mall near the beverly center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
never too crowded and always great service .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .|||O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP O
i appreciate their delivery too .|||O O O B-AP O O
nice food but no spice !|||O B-AP O O O O
i really enjoyed my meal here .|||O O O O B-AP O O
i had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O O
the food was all good but it was way too mild .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the naan was some of the best i 've had and i really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
even the chickpeas , which i normally find too dry , were good .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas , everything is delicious .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O
i love the warm & cosy environment .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party , ca n't wait to celebrate my next birthday there .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've been to open sesame only once , but i 'm still reeling from the experience ! !|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is simply unforgettable !|||O B-AP O O O O
the presentation of the food was an added bonus , it looked just as great as it tasted !|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere !|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O
go to open sesame ! ! !|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
holy hummus !|||O B-AP O
the food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne (yogurt dip) .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
also , they serve the best hummus in america , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil which , i believe is the traditional way !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
however , this place is a gem , and i wo n't stop going back .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible !|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
the band was very good and the service was attentive .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O
we ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer cold and good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
ray 's suprisingly has the city 's best & most diverse wine list .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the sommelier is fantastic , down-to-earth , & extremely knowlegable .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i would go back for the wine experience alone .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O
not the place it once was|||O O B-AP O O O
it is sad to see a place that was once the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch , now be the place that is a big dont bother .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the food is not what it once was potions have seriously seen downsizing prices have gone up , and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere including mainland europe .|||O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
this establishment really made a marked decline after and this is recurring story the airing of food televisions diners , drive-ins , and dives hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perhaps now , scooner or later falls into the dive category .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
open & cool place with the best pizza and coffee|||O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O

great meal , the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent - there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi - this fish was perfect ! ! ! !|||O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

well i guess it 's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , are you waiting for a table ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

the nicest waiters in town .|||O O B-AP O O O
this place is unbelievably over-rated .|||O B-AP O O O O
if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then i would put murphy 's at the top of the list .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

poor customer service pizza .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
as with most restaurants in seattle , mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
to be honest , i 've had better frozen pizza .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews , this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we 've eaten here more than 10 times .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problem would be the wait , but we usually just have a drink in the front while wait .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O

the food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
we had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
i waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we left without ever getting service .|||O O O O O B-AP O
best crab cakes in town|||O B-AP I-AP O O
thats a big statement considering i 've been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven , but something about these little devils gets better every time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can , come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O

great pizza , poor service|||O B-AP O O O
love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .|||O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
also love their caeser salad .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .|||B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
this place is famous for their breakfast .|||O O O O O O B-AP O

i love breakfast here .|||O O B-AP O O
their crab eggs benedict is addicting .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
all their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter soooo good the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee oh la la yummy ! ! ! .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant even for nyc .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i 'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
terrible service , food ok , pricey|||O B-AP O B-AP O O O
in other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their service scale ' .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi that eel with avodcao - um um um .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
as usual the omikase did n't disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their specialty rolls are impressive , though i ca n't remember what we had .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O

green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it .|||B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
it is n't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
very poor customer service .|||O O B-AP I-AP O
schooner or later 's charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been blown off would be an understatement .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager continually interrupted with is there anything else i can do for you ? , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi this might be the place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
great service .|||O B-AP O

we were only in seattle for one night and i 'm so glad we picked rays for dinner !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i love dungeness crabs and at ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ! .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O
and the service was simply spendid , quite a delight .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O

best neighborhood standby .|||O O B-AP O
in grammercy/union square/east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
oh , and the cheese fries are awesome !|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
good food , great service , average prices for the strip|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O
i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
it was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was ok .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the steak was done to my exact liking medium rare and was nice and juicy .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O
overall , i would go back and eat at the restaurant again .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
good sake , good food , i honestly do n't know much about japanese food at all .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
server made several sake suggestions which were very good .|||B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O
had many dishes but the best was the lobster 3 ways .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .|||O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
also , there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
at best , the food was good and definately overpriced .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O

the pizza's are light and scrumptious .|||O B-AP O O O O O
try the pizza ensalata !|||O O B-AP I-AP O
the pizza's are not huge and the crust is thin keep that in mind when you 're ordering .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is sinful .|||O B-AP O O O
the staff was really friendly .|||O B-AP O O O O
the atmosphere was great .|||O B-AP O O O
the specialty here is decadent pancakes , but i 've been back now four times , and i 've been wowed every time .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing on the menu is less than amazing .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O
go with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
good eats .|||O B-AP O
i do n't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i have been to this place , folks and it is bad .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half-way decent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
i have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and not one was eatable .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O

to the owners of open sesame ca n't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant ! .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend thurs ? sun you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you 're interested in good tasting without the fish taste or smell , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
the pepperoni's cut real thick -- yum .|||O B-AP O O O O O O

food was good and appetizing .|||B-AP O O O O O
portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fair menu selection .|||O B-AP I-AP O
the appetizer was interesting , but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
indoor ambience was modern .|||B-AP I-AP O O O
if it 's nice outside , request for a table in the balcony .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it 's a great place to people watch .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
late night dinning with exeptional food .|||O O O O O B-AP O
we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the service was exceptional , sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i 've ever try .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
the portions are big though , so do not order too much .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
groovy music made the dinner casual .|||O B-AP O O O O O
i have a but here , there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place rocks ! !|||O B-AP O O O
mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

the catering is out of this world , and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !|||O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
drinks are suberb , and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
to start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 850 for 3 , 6 pancakes one of them was more like 5 in the pancake flight sample of 3 different pancakes is well over-priced .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the pancakes should be larger at least 8 to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea i had water .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
much more than just a great view !|||O O O O O O B-AP O
i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about ray's !|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
for my entr & eacute ; e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique not to mention tasty .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue , who thinks that ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
all considered , i have to say that ray's boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O
oh yeahthe view was good , too .|||O O B-AP O O O O O
