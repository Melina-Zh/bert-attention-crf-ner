did not enjoy the new windows 8 and touchscreen functions .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
other than not being a fan of click pads industry standard these days and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook i do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

the battery life is excellent 6-7 hours without charging .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the baterry is very longer .|||O B-AP O O O O
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
this laptop has only 2 usb ports , and they are both on the same side .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O

biggest complaint is windows 8 .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
only 2 usb ports kind oflimited .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
it has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
i was extremely happy with the os itself .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
ms office 2011 for mac is wonderful , well worth it .|||B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O

the mountain lion os is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
however , i can refute that osx is fast .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O

cons , screen resolution .|||O O B-AP I-AP O

once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
it 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port will work with adapter and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O

i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O

i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
quick and has built in virus control .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
one more thing , this mac does not come with restore disks and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iphone/ipod touch cables .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
apple "help" is a mixed bag .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O
it suddenly can not work .|||O O O O B-AP O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation audio , video , photo editing and its reliable .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O
screen is bright and gorgeous .|||B-AP O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O

and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery lasts as advertised give or take 15-20 minutes , and the entire user experience is very elegant .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
thanks for the fast shipment and great price .|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
! excelent performance , usability , presentation and time response .|||O O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O
the smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O

it 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which i did n't know until after i bought it .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
it came in brand new and works perfectly .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O

price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .|||O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O

my last laptop was a 17 asus gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count pretty surprised , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and as for all the fancy finger swipes - i just gave up and attached a mouse .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O

the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
maybe the mac os improvement were not the product they want to offer .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

the like new condition of the imac mc309ll/a on amazon is at $ 900+ level only , and it is a quad-core 2.5 ghz cpu similar to the $ 799 mini , with radeon hd 6750m 512mb graphic card this mini is integrated intel 4000 card , and it even comes with wireless apple keyboard and mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O

within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O

it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

not sure on windows 8 .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O

i was given a demonstration of windows 8 .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the mbp is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
i thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
runs very smoothly .|||B-AP O O O
boot-up slowed significan'tly after all windows updates were installed .|||B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O
i like the mini mac it was easy to setup and install , but i am learning as i go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features i was use to on the pc especially the right mouse click menu .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O

buy the separate ram memory and you will have a rocket !|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
wifi capability , disk drive and multiple usb ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .|||B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
the sd card reader is slightly recessed and upside down the nail slot on the card can not be accessed , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O

first of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16gb of ram , two seagate momentus xt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the dell inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard , which i miss on my apple laptops .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
i was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried , this machine is the fastest i have ever owned .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one still has the cd slot .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
no hdmi port .|||O B-AP I-AP O
i had to install mountain lion and it took a good two hours .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
customization on mac is impossible .|||B-AP O O O O O
i am replacing the hd with a micron ssd soon .|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O
plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
the superdrive is quiet .|||O B-AP O O O
the power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the os is great .|||O B-AP O O O
i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .|||O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
cons , price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
the troubleshooting said it was the ac adaptor so we ordered a new one .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
fan only comes on when you are playing a game .|||B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
which it did not have , only 3 usb 2 ports .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
there is no "tools" menu .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
needs a cd/dvd drive and a bigger power switch .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O
my laptop with windows 7 crashed and i did not want windows 8 .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

the speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker this is a great little laptop love it ! .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice packing .|||O B-AP O
i switched to this because i wanted something different , even though i miss windows .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also wanted windows 7 , which this one has .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the mac system .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
its as advertised on here it works great and is not a waste of money ! .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
runs like a champ .|||B-AP O O O O
premium price for the os more than anything else .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this mac book pro along with a new 27 imac and while they are still light years more reliable than a pc i have noticed a decline in the reliability of my mac computers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
even though i could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price i still think there 's nothing like a mac .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
instead , i 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .|||O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
chatting with acer support , i was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
it 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and i 'm struggle with finding the correct keys but that was expected .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
many people complain about the new os , and it 's urgent for apple to fix it asap !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i have upgraded to lion i am much happier about mac os and have just bought an imac for office .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
user upgradeable ram and hdd .|||O O B-AP O B-AP O
but i wanted the pro for the cd/dvd player .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the ram memory is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .|||O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
i then upgraded to mac os x 10.8 "mountain lion" .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
just beware no dvd slot so when i went to install software i had on cd i could n't .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
this version of macbook pro runs on a third-generation cpu ("ivy bridge") , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
put a ssd and use a 21" led screen , this set up is silky smooth !|||O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O
i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
when considering a mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 usb ports .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazoncom than it was in the mac store .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O
i will upgrade the ram myself because with this model you can you can do it later on .|||O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price is 200 dollars down .|||O B-AP O O O O O
this mac mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its mac os 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .|||O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was n't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the ios system on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .|||O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O
working with mac is so much easier , so many cool features .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i like the brightness and adjustments .|||O O O B-AP O B-AP O
i only wish this mac had a cd/dvd player built in .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
the only thing i miss is that my old alienware laptop had backlit keys .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the only thing i miss are the "home/end" type keys and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .|||O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the speed , the simplicity , the design it is lightyears ahead of any pc i have ever owned .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
the screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
i also made a recovery usb stick .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
but with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sound tinny .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O
the built quality is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast performance also .|||O O O O O B-AP O O
further , this mac mini has a sloppy bluetooth interface courtesy of the mac os and the range is poor .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O
if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
