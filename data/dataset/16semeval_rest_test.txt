Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.####Ray=O 's=O is=O something=O of=O a=O Seattle=O institution=O ,=O but=O given=O its=O gorgeous=O Sound=T views=T ,=O I=O had=O suspected=O that=O the=O accolades=O were=O more=O due=O to=O the=O scenery=O than=O to=O the=O food=O and=O service=O .=O

My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.####My=O party=O of=O two=O was=O feeling=O particularly=O ambitious=O ,=O and=O we=O splurged=O on=O the=O Shilshole=T Sampler=T beautiful=O assortment=O of=O enormous=O white=T gulf=T prawns=T ,=O smoked=O albacore=O tuna=O ,=O Ray=O 's=O fantastic=O manila=T clams=T seasoned=O with=O dill=O ,=O scallops=O in=O a=O tasty=O soy=T dressing=T ,=O and=O a=O tiny=O pile=O of=O Dungeness=O crab=O atop=O a=O sublime=O butter=T sauce=T .=O
