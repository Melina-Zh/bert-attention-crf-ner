boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but in resume this computer rocks !|||O O O O O O O
set up was easy .|||B-AP I-AP O O O
did not enjoy the new windows 8 and touchscreen functions .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O
i expected so as it 's an apple product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the laptop to buy right now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other than not being a fan of click pads industry standard these days and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook i do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

this mac has been a problem since we got it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
i am pleased with the fast log on , speedy wifi connection and the long battery life > 6 hrs .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
the apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
made interneting part of my business very difficult to maintain .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the mac mini is priced just right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
small and still very powerful .|||O O O O O O
i had gotten this model for $ 119900 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a macbook at the local bestbuy ! .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
super light , super sexy and everything just works .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O
only problem that i had was that the track pad was not very good for me , i only had a problem once or twice with it , but probably my computer was a bit defective .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you are switching from a pc i hilghy sugest this one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is super fast and has outstanding graphics .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
but the mountain lion is just too slow .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
strong build though which really adds to its durability .|||O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O
the battery life is excellent 6-7 hours without charging .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
i enjoy having apple products .|||O O O O O O
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
i will never go back to a pc again !|||O O O O O O O O O O
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the baterry is very longer .|||O B-AP O O O O
and it 's so quiet that i do n't hear it at all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .|||O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to me it 's a workhorse and quiet as can be you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to uncle sam definite buy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
i 'm pretty sure when i bought it , my bank account went ouch !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank you so much for the great item .|||O O O O O O O O O
this laptop has only 2 usb ports , and they are both on the same side .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever buy any acer products .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is why i purchased a brand new laptop in the first place so it would n't have any problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .|||O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O
as for the laptop , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything i wanted and everything i needed and the price was great !|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
it is better than my old acer laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O
this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy it again in a heartbeat !|||O O O O O O O O O
keyboard responds well to presses .|||B-AP O O O O O
if someone called me an apple fanboyit would make sense .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
lastly , windows 8 is annoying .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
a scratch on a $ 1,500 macbook is unforgivable .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i just fell in love with this thing .|||O O O O O O O O O
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
i have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this laptop is a great buy .|||O O O O O O O
biggest complaint is windows 8 .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
only 2 usb ports kind oflimited .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this device has met my expectations and i 'm sure it will meet yours .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
i can never go back to a pc now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
i was extremely happy with the os itself .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O
i was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss out on the black friday deals .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
ms office 2011 for mac is wonderful , well worth it .|||B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the performance of mac mini is a huge disappointment .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
there has been no problem with anything .|||O O O O O O O O
i believe with apple , you get what you pay for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
i have had it over a year now with out a glitch of any kindi love the lit up keys and screen display thing is fast and clear as can be .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
the product is prefect for everyone .|||O O O O O O O
the mountain lion os is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows .|||O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
however , i can refute that osx is fast .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i waited to review to make sure it is what it is .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
enjoy using microsoft office !|||O O B-AP I-AP O
i would suggest this product to anyone .|||O O O O O O O O
with no problems , i 'm happy with this purchase because i saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc laptop after pc laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just bit the bullet and bought the mac hoping it will last a lot longer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
built-in apps are purely amazing .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O
cons , screen resolution .|||O O B-AP I-AP O
from the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats windows easily .|||O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O O
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
this is by far thee best , most reliable computer i could find .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty $ 1500-2000 which also support accidents like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it 's light and easy to transport .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
very powerful especially for the money .|||O O O O O O O
when my dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , i decided to buy macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
this was a significan'tly more affordable than getting a new macbook pro from apple .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have always wanted a macbook proalways ! .|||O O O O O O O O O
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !|||O O O O O O O O O O
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
he 's thrilled with his new laptop .|||O O O O O O O O
amazing product as you would expect from apple .|||O O O O O O O O O
nothing wrong with this computer at all !|||O O O O O O O O
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
i have to wonder why amazon is even selling this dinosaur .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port will work with adapter and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
no hassle and no complaints .|||O O O O O O
love it i 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads and iphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
well designed and fast .|||O B-AP O O O
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !|||O O O O O O O O O O
but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
exactly as posted plus a great value .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
the specs are pretty good too .|||O B-AP O O O O O
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've only had it one day , but i really do love it and i 'm happy it was economical and i 'm finally able to own a mac !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since i have always used apple products , the choice of macbook pro was obvious .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
this is my first apple laptop .|||O O O O O O O
it makes a great gift .|||O O O O O O
it is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O
i would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not like too much windows 8 .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
startup times are incredibly long , over two minutes .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
i bought this macbook pro from best buy under a year ago to replace my old macbook air .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the macbook pro is really responsive .|||O O O O O O O
also stunning colors and speedy|||O O B-AP O O
it is really expensive though .|||O O O O O O
great price free shipping what else can i ask for ! !|||O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O
this mouse is terrific .|||O B-AP O O O
i will also say it is much better than i expected !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
this computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really thick around the battery .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
and windows 7 works like a charm .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
and i can attach my projector to it .|||O O O O O O O O O
, great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .|||O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
, ] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
tried windows 8 and hated it ! ! !|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i thought why not give mac book pro a try .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
set up was a breeze .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O
but i do not like win8 .|||O O O O O B-AP O
i have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers , but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am still in the process of learning about its features .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
btw , i checked online regarding the old laptop that died and found that i was not alone , far from it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had the same reasons as most pc users , the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very nice so far .|||O O O O O
you wo n't be disappointed .|||O O O O O O
the investment of a new macbook pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found the mini to be , exceptionally easy to set up|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
having usb3 is why i bought this mini .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O
be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
this was the same problem with my macbook circa 2007 that i just retired .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great things come in small packages .|||O O O O O O O
huge apple mac fan !|||O O O O O
looked at hp , asus , acer , sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find i really liked .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the settings are not user-friendly either .|||O B-AP O O O O O
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank goodness for openoffice !|||O O O B-AP O
awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful ux .|||O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O
needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and aside from the financial reasons i am astounded that i had n't made the switch sooner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its perfect , not much heavy .|||O O O O O O O
i love the keyboard and the screen .|||O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
i find it not to be very user friendly .|||O O O O O O O O O O
it has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
what angers me more than anything else is that i spent all those years hating macs when i could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
so this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 34499 ? .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
you will not regret buying this computer !|||O O O O O O O O
nothing bad to say about it .|||O O O O O O O
it s heavy for mac book but is good .|||O O O O O O O O O O
thanks for great service and shipping !|||O O O B-AP O B-AP O
deal of the year .|||O O O O O
my sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
minis make sense for a lot of people .|||O O O O O O O O O
the performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iphoto work great with my phone and camera .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O
this mac mini makes the macbook pro seem slow .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
i bought this macbook pro to replace my six-year-old pc a sony vaio , but it was basically no better than my old pc , so i returned it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a simple , reliable laptop .|||O O O O O O O O
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !|||O O O O O O O O
i have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
extremely disappointed with the way it is .|||O O O O O O O O
never been happier using computer .|||O O O O O O
i have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i wanted this laptop to do .|||O O O O O O O O O
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
turns out this is a common problem .|||O O O O O O O O
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
it is also fast as can be you get what you pay for well worth the investment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !|||O O O O O O O O O O
yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
very fast for my needs .|||O O O O O O
i bought this mac in order to replace my old dell laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quick and has built in virus control .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
i saw the mini mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par product .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have n't regretted it one bit .|||O O O O O O O
the one thing that apple does right is computers .|||O O O O O O O O O O
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i think that they are the best out on the market .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
that 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my laptop is so light that i can take it with me anywhere .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
you can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally decided to try a mac because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had a mac said buy a mac .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ?|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
it feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
that defeated the whole point of a laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
but until now , no complains at all .|||O O O O O O O O O
the cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
does everything i need it to , has a wonderful battery life and i could n't be happier .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
great performance and quality .|||O B-AP O B-AP O
just what i needed for portable and my wallet too !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
the device speaks about it self .|||O O O O O O O
i used windows xp , windows vista , and windows 7 extensively .|||O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after i bought this one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

not something you want to miss out on ! ! !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing , this mac does not come with restore disks and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iphone/ipod touch cables .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O

the mac mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks using the mac mini ! ! !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i was told that it seems to be a multi , component failure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
i am very happy with my first mac .|||O O O O O O O O O
easy to set up and go !|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O
i ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
the machine is speedy and efficient .|||O O O O O O O
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
a *big* upgrade from my 13 2006 macbook .|||O O O O O O O O O
it 's just what we were looking for and it works great .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
having a mac certainly makes life easier .|||O O O O O O O O
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working on a computer so much more pleasurable !|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .|||O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
for this purpose , it 's great .|||O O O O O O O O
could n't have asked for more !|||O O O O O O O
i 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and i 'm learning programming .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
it certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with mac 's complain about anything .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
apple "help" is a mixed bag .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O
all i can say is i am impressed .|||O O O O O O O O O
it suddenly can not work .|||O O O O B-AP O
it did everything we expected !|||O O O O O O
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O
it 's a nice little gadget .|||O O O O O O O
my only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
it 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
i use it mostly for content creation audio , video , photo editing and its reliable .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O O O O
it is the best all around mac .|||O O O O O O O O
screen is bright and gorgeous .|||B-AP O O O O O
also is portable and reliable .|||O O O O O O
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but i am very satisfied .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is fast and easy to use .|||O O O O O O B-AP O
this was absolutely annoying !|||O O O O O
and the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
but for those of you that do n't have a mac and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been pc for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O

i 've installed to it additional ssd and 16gb ram .|||O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O

its pretty much fire it up and go .|||O O O O O O O O O
it works great and i am so happy i bought it .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
let me start off by saying that i was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .|||O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O
apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i went from a macbook to this mac mini and this was a great upgrade !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
web browsing is very quick with safari browser .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it could n't have been a better decision .|||O O O O O O O O O
i like the lighted screen at night .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
it 's great to have a solid mac in the living room .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
very light and easily maneuverable .|||O O O O O O
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .|||B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O
this can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
i am not happy with my purchase|||O O O O O O O
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery lasts as advertised give or take 15-20 minutes , and the entire user experience is very elegant .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
i spent months looking for a good laptop for me and i finally found it !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

thanks for the fast shipment and great price .|||O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O
! excelent performance , usability , presentation and time response .|||O O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O
the smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
i blame the mac os .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
but for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact i still use manyaspect0 appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc !|||O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O
it 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful in resume , it 's a mac ! .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , it runs xp and microsoft is dropping support next april .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first off , i really do like my mbp once used to the os it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O

buy the mac mini it 's a terribly great machine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
it is made of such solid construction and since i have never had a mac using my iphone helped me get used to the system a bit .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
i love this piece of equipment , it will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very nice unibody construction .|||O O B-AP I-AP O
very disappointed with apple .|||O O O O O
this macbook pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
***the review below is no longer relevant , apple has fixed the issue .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which i did n't know until after i bought it .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O
it really is very light compared to other computers .|||O O O O O O O O O O

this machine is a-mazing .|||O O O O O
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
my trackpad is not working .|||O B-AP O O O O
i just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friendsit did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
considering another computer should be out of the question|||O O O O O O O O O
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .|||O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
its worth every penny .|||O O O O O
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
this was a great deal for a decked out macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .|||O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .|||O O O O O O O O O O
the configuration is perfect for my needs .|||O B-AP O O O O O O
and the speakers is the worst ever .|||O O B-AP O O O O O

have one myself and love it !|||O O O O O O O
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
stop living in the stone age and buy a mac , you will not be sorry at all ! !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my last laptop was a 17 asus gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count pretty surprised , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n't be more pleased .|||O O O O O O O
and as for all the fancy finger swipes - i just gave up and attached a mouse .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so i can photoshop without any problem .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i like coming back to mac os but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp laptop .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O

there were small problems with mac office .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it is extremely fast and very compact .|||O O O O O O O O

i ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 imacs .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O

you can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
performance is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
if you get a lemon i have two thirds of my macs , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i do n't want it too , i would recommend using a mouse with it .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O
yeah , it 's super expensive .|||O O O O O O O

maybe the mac os improvement were not the product they want to offer .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
it came before the day it supposed to which is great .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !|||O O O O O O O B-AP O
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .|||O O O O O O O O O O
i am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
buying a mac mini would allow me to make the transition .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O

not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O
i am very satisfied with the mini .|||O O O O O O O O
the audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

boot-up slowed significan'tly after all windows updates were installed .|||B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

all the above aside this machine rocks !|||O O O O O O O O
buy the separate ram memory and you will have a rocket !|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .|||O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
bottom line , if you can afford it , get a mac !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the macbook pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried , this machine is the fastest i have ever owned .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

cons , price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O
if that is the case , then i am completely happy|||O O O O O O O O O O O
10/10 five stars would recommend .|||O O O O O O

no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
there is no "tools" menu .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
needs a cd/dvd drive and a bigger power switch .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O

besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .|||O O O O O O O O O
i switched to this because i wanted something different , even though i miss windows .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing pc laptops .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !|||O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also wanted windows 7 , which this one has .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O
at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the mac system .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
they replaced it and so far so good .|||O O O O O O O O O
it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .|||O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O

its as advertised on here it works great and is not a waste of money ! .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O

i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this mac book pro along with a new 27 imac and while they are still light years more reliable than a pc i have noticed a decline in the reliability of my mac computers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
then only four months later , my great macbook pro failed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
even though i could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price i still think there 's nothing like a mac .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all you get is a box and a computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O

the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
instead , i 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i stayed up half the night enjoying my new macbook pro .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
this laptop is a 100 times better than a chromebook !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
chatting with acer support , i was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .|||O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
it 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and i 'm struggle with finding the correct keys but that was expected .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
many people complain about the new os , and it 's urgent for apple to fix it asap !|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O

i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ultimate graduation gift .|||O O O O O
the ram memory is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , i just did n't really wan na spend the money but im glad that i did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i am an info sys major in college , so i started researching this issue on my own .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
solution , it turned out to be pretty simple .|||O O O O O O O O O O
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .|||O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
still have n't solved this .|||O O O O O O
i then upgraded to mac os x 10.8 "mountain lion" .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O
it is extremely fast and never lags .|||O O O O O O O O
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
hopefully my replacement is brand new .|||O O O O O O O
just beware no dvd slot so when i went to install software i had on cd i could n't .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O
this version of macbook pro runs on a third-generation cpu ("ivy bridge") , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
actually , i think i was intimidated by the change from a pc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O
definitely worth spending the money on it .|||O O O O O O O O
i have three words , piece of junk !|||O O O O O O O O O
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
fits all my personal needs .|||O O O O O O
i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O
i wanted to explore what the mac was all about .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 133 macbook pro model # md101ll/a .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
put a ssd and use a 21" led screen , this set up is silky smooth !|||O O B-AP O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP O
i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
when considering a mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 usb ports .|||O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O B-AP O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O
a great college tool !|||O O O O O
the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i called apple and no solution .|||O O O O O O O
it 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .|||O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazoncom than it was in the mac store .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
the worst a mac ever did to me was freeze up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
the nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP O
i am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
no star for this trash [ .|||O O O O O O O
i will upgrade the ram myself because with this model you can you can do it later on .|||O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price is 200 dollars down .|||O B-AP O O O O O
this mac mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its mac os 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .|||O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was n't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the ios system on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
quietest laptop i have ever owned .|||O O O O O O O
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .|||O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O
again this is just my personal honest opinion .|||O O O O O O O O O
if you have much higher expectations than that i would look elsewhere .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
working with mac is so much easier , so many cool features .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
i 'm going to buy a logitevh c270 .|||O O O O O O O O O
very happy with my purchase .|||O O O O O O

i 'm so happy with my macbook pro !|||O O O O O O O O O
i only wish this mac had a cd/dvd player built in .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O
the only thing i miss is that my old alienware laptop had backlit keys .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the only thing i miss are the "home/end" type keys and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .|||O O O B-AP O B-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
the speed , the simplicity , the design it is lightyears ahead of any pc i have ever owned .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love everything about this computer .|||O O O O O O O
i found it toughest to decide between dell ultra books and apple .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O
the screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .|||O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
while we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't want to run a computer ; i want to use a computer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O
i also made a recovery usb stick .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
being a pc user for many years to switch to a mac i will not go back .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sound tinny .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O
i do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this macbook pro laptop you get what you pay for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 've almost have bought every generation of macminis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the built quality is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .|||O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am loving the fast performance also .|||O O O O O B-AP O O
i had to return it because it would n't even start .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
further , this mac mini has a sloppy bluetooth interface courtesy of the mac os and the range is poor .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O B-AP I-AP O O B-AP O O O
great deal on an amazing lap top !|||O O O O O O O O
if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
best money i ever spent .|||O O O O O O
my only gripe would be the need to add more ram .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a pc .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fine if you have a touch screen .|||O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
can never go wrong with apple products .|||O O O O O O O O
as far as user type , i dabble in everything from games wow to photoshop , but nothing professionally .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP O O O O O
it doesnt get hot like my pc , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime i forget how to do something i just google it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i re-seated the "wlan" card inside and re-installed the lan device drivers .|||O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
this by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life amazing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O
i have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but i love it already .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the os is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O
i had to get apple customer support to correct the problem .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O
ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a veryimportant feature is firewire 800 which in my experience works better then usb3 in pc enabled with usb3 was not originally sold on the mac os i felt it was inferior in many ways to windows 7 .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O B-AP O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i like itunes , the apparent security , the mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .|||O O B-AP O O O B-AP O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O B-AP I-AP O
the first time i used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .|||O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
this flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else apple got right with the mini .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .|||O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
i know some people complained about hdmi issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .|||O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O
with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best specs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O
added an imac about 2 years later .|||O O O O O O O O
packing and everything was perfect|||B-AP O O O O
i will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends|||O O O O O O O O O O O
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
i seem to be having repeat problems as the mother board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .|||O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
it also comes with 4g of ram but if you 're like me you want to max that out so i immediately put 8g of ram in her and i 've never used a computer that performs better .|||O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O O
this computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .|||O O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O
cost is more as compared to other brands .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O
also excellent operating system size and weight for optimal mobility excellent durability of the battery the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand- .|||O O B-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP O O B-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O B-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP I-AP O O O O O O O
this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .|||O B-AP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm done with windoze computers .|||O O O O O O O
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AP O B-AP O
the latest version does not have a disc drive .|||O O O O O O O B-AP I-AP O
screen , although some people might complain about low res which i think is ridiculous .|||B-AP O O O O O O O O B-AP O O O O O O
